  <h1>One Extra Step</h1>
  <p>For the extension to open links in the Firefox browser, please download, unzip and install the open-source native client.</p>
  <ul id="steps">
    <li>Select native runtime: <select id="runtime">
      <option value="com.add0n.node">NodeJS (com.add0n.node)</option>
      <option value="org.webextension.bun">BunJS (org.webextension.bun)</option>
    </select></li>
    <li class="step1">Click <a href="#" data-cmd="download">here</a> to download the package for you OS (Window, Mac, and Linux operating systems are currently supported) or click <a href="https://github.com/andy-portmen/native-client/releases" target="_blank">NodeJS Runtime</a> or <a href="https://github.com/andy-portmen/native-client-bunjs/releases" target="_blank">BunJS Runtime</a> to browse all available download options.</li>
    <li>Extract the downloaded package in a local directory</li>
    <li class="linux">Now open a terminal in this directory (the directory that contains install.sh and uninstall.sh) and run <code>./install.sh</code></li>
    <li class="windows">Now double-click the <code>install.bat</code> file</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="flex">
    <input type="button" data-cmd="check" value="Check Connection Status">
  </div>
  <p class="note canhide">"com.add0n.node" is based on <a href="https://nodejs.org/en" target="_blank">NodeJS</a> and is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. This package includes NodeJS binary for your operating system and uses it if you don't have NodeJS installed on your system.</p>
  <p class="note canhide">"org.webextension.bun" is based on <a href="https://bun.sh/" target="_blank">BunJS</a> and is available for macOS, and Linux. For this native client to work, you need to have BunJS installed on your system. The package does not include the native binaries.</p>
  <p class="note canhide">The installer script copies a few files to two different locations for your browser to be able to detect this native client. If you already have NodeJS in your system, the installed version of NodeJS will be used. So please make sure you have an up-to-date version of NodeJS installed. If you don't have this application, the portable version will be used. Read more <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/andy-portmen/native-client">here</a>.</p>
  <p class="note">To make sure the native client is accessible, click on the "<a href="#" data-cmd="check">Check Connection</a>" button. <span id="alternative">If you still get this page even when the "Check Button" reports successful connection, it means the application cannot be accessed (path is not correct in the <a href="#" data-cmd="options">options page</a>)</span>. If the path to the executable is correct and the native client is connected, you can debug the connection by enabling console logs in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.chromium.org/for-testers/enable-logging">Chrome, Edge, Opera</a>, or <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Tools/Browser_Console">Firefox</a>.</p>
  <p class="note canhide">To completely remove this native client, run <code class="linux">./uninstall.sh</code><code class="windows">uninstall.bat</code>.</p>
  <p class="note canhide">If you are using an unpacked extension, make sure to include the extension id (<code id="extension">-</code>) into the <code>config.js</code> file and reinstall.</p>
